# A journey through personal growth and the challenges with it

This is a personal blog challenge set out by Jeremy Howard of fast.ai as part of learning the fast.ai course to blog about your experiences and learnings as you go through your journey of learning deep learning. 

This will be probably at times pretty raw, hopefully as honest as it can be and thoughtful. I'll do my best to keep it regular in amongst my life as a dad, startup founder and all the other things that come with that. I have so much to learn as a non-technical person, this has been part of a journey to becoming technical which initially began with the desire to spend more time building things in web3 (Javascript/Typescript/Solidity). However with the advent of AI and LLMs this is somewhat of a pivot now into Python, deep learning and putting it all together into products.

I don't know where this will go, it seems like an endless cycle of build/rebuild with the improvements in AI coming hard and fast but let's see where this goes.
